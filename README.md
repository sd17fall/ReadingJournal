# Software Design Reading Journal

This is the base repository for Software Design reading exercises and journal notebooks.

## Active Reading

When learning programming, it's not enough to simply read a textbook. You must be an active reader with hands on keyboards, trying out examples and working through problems as you learn.

In this class, we scaffold this activity through reading journals, implemented as [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks (previously known as iPython notebooks). These allow you to read, take notes, and work through problems, all in one place.

Follow the instructions on the [Set Up page](http://softdes.olin.build/setup/) to create your own copy of the reading journal repository.

Follow the instructions on the [Reading Journal Instructions](http://softdes.olin.build/reading-journal/) to submit completed reading journal notebooks.
